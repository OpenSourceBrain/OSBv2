# OSBv2

An updated version of the Open Source Brain platform

## Deploy

### Prerequisites

The OSB deployment is built on top of [CloudHarness](https://github.com/MetaCell/cloud-harness).
The deployment process is based on Python 3.7+ scripts. It is recommended to setup a virtual
environment first.

With conda:
```bash
conda create --name osb python=3.9
conda activate osb
```

To install CloudHarness:

```
git clone https://github.com/MetaCell/cloud-harness.git
cd cloud-harness
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Install skaffold

skaffold is needed to build the images and run them on minikube.
Get it [here](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/).

#### Install helm

You can install helm from [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Create deployment

CloudHarness scripts script automate the deployment process.

To manually create the helm chart to use on any Kubernetes deployment, run:

```
harness-deployment cloud-harness .
```
### Cluster setup

Kubernetes 1.19+ is supported (v1 spec)

#### Cert-manager
The cert-manager must be installed in order to use letsencrypt generated certificates

To check if cert-manager is installed, run:
```
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
```
If cert manager is installed, the command will return 3 lines.

To install the cert manager on a new cluster, run:
```
kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.15.1/cert-manager-legacy.yaml
```

See also https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/.

#### CSI driver

On google cloud, the **Compute Engine persistent disk CSI Driver** must be enabled in order for the volume cloning to work.

### Install and upgrade with Helm

1. Create the namespace `kubectl create ns osb2`
1. Run  `helm install osb2 deployment/helm  --namespace osb2` to install.
1. Run `kubectl create rolebinding osb-admin-default --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=osb2:default -n osb2` to allow workflows to run on namespace osb2

To upgrade an existing deployment, use:

```
helm upgrade osb2 deployment/helm --namespace osb2 --install --reset-values [--force]
```

## Development setup

Minikube is recommended to setup locally. The procedure is different depending on where Minikube is installed.
The simplest procedure is with Minikube hosted in the same machine where running the commands.


### Initialize Minikube cluster

At least 6GB of ram and 4 processors are needed to run MNP

To create a new cluster, run
```
minikube start --memory="6000mb" --cpus=4 --disk-size=60000mb
```

Enable the ingress addon:

```
minikube addons enable ingress
```

Create the namespace `kubectl create ns osblocal`

### Minikube on the host machine

Connect your docker registry with minikube with:
`eval $(minikube docker-env)`

Then run:
```
harness-deployment cloud-harness . -l  -n osblocal -d osb.local -u -dtls -e local -i osb-portal
```
You do not need to run the port-forwarding commands on the local deployment.

Here, you can modify the argument of the `-e` option to select what environment you want to deploy.
These correspond to the files from the `osb-portal/deploy` directory.
So, selecting the environment will load specific overriding configuration files (like `[APP_NAME]/deploy/values-[ENV].yaml`) specific to the environment.

If you only want to run the back-end in the minikube deployment, change the `osb-portal` to `workspaces`.
You can then use `npm start:minikube` to point `npm` to the local minikube back-end.
Note that the domain in `package.json` for the `start:minikube` command should match the namespace used for minikube.

Finally, run skaffold to build and run the images on minikube:

```
skaffold dev
```

On making local changes, you can re-run the `harness-deployment` command to update the deployment.

### Minikube on a different machine

With the registry on localhost:5000 run:
```
harness-deployment cloud-harness . -l  -n osblocal -d osb.local -u -dtls -e local -i osb-portal -r registry:5000
```

See below to learn how to configure Minikube and forward the registry.

#### Setup kubectl

If Minikube is installed in a different machine, the following procedure will allow to connect kubectl.

1. Install kubectl in the client machine
1. copy `~/.minikube` from the client to the server (skip cache and machines)
1. Copy `~/.kube/config` from the Minikube server to the client machine (make a backup of the previous version) and adjust paths to match the home folder on the client machine

##### Kube configuration copy

If you don't want to replace the whole content of the configuration you can copy only
 the relevant entries in `~/.kube/config` from the server to the client on `clusters`, `context`

Examples:

On `clusters`
```yaml
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: /home/user/.minikube/ca.crt
    server: https://192.168.99.106:8443
  name: minikube
```

On `context`
```yaml
- context:
    cluster: minikube
    user: minikube
  name: minikube
```

On `users`
```yaml
- name: minikube
  user:
    client-certificate: /home/user/.minikube/client.crt
    client-key: /home/user/.minikube/client.key
```

Set default context:
```yaml
current-context: minikube
```

#### Set up the Docker registry

In the case we are not building from the same machine as the cluster (which will always happen without Minikube),
we need a way to share the registry.

Procedure to share registry:5000 from a kube cluster

In the minikube installation:

```bash
minikube addons enable registry
```

In order to use the registry address add the following entry to the hosts file

```
[MINIKUBE_ADDRESS]  registry
```

To also add the name to minikube:

```
% minikube ssh
$ sudo su
$ echo "127.0.0.1  registry" >> /etc/hosts
```

Also may need to [add the host to the insecure registry on your docker configuration](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49674004/docker-repository-server-gave-http-response-to-https-client/54190375).

To use localhost, on the machine running the infrastructure-generate script, run

```bash
kubectl port-forward --namespace kube-system $(kubectl get po -n kube-system --field-selector=status.phase=Running | grep registry | grep -v proxy | \awk '{print $1;}') 5000:5000
```
